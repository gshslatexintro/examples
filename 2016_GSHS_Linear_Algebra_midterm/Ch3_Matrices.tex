\section{Terminology}

\textit{Definition.} A \textbf{matrix} is a rectangular array of numbers, which are called as \textbf{entries} or \textbf{elements}. If the matrix has $n$ rows and $m$ columns, the \textbf{size} of the matrix is $n \times m$.

\noindent \\ A $1 \times n$ matrix is called a \textbf{row matrix}, or \textbf{row vector}. A $n \times 1$ matrix is called a \textbf{column matrix}, or \textbf{column vector}. (\textit{A vector is considered as a matrix}) We can denote matrices using row vectors or column vectors, such as 
\begin{align*}
A = \begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{A}^{C}_1 & \textbf{A}^{C}_2 & \cdots & \textbf{A}^{C}_m
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{A}^{R}_1 \\ \textbf{A}^{R}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \textbf{A}^{R}_n
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*} where $\textbf{A}^{C}_i$ is the $i$th column of $A$ and $\textbf{A}^{R}_i$ is the $i$th row of $A$.

\noindent \\ The element at $i$th row and $j$th column is denoted by $A_{ij}$. We can also denote matrices using elements, such as $A = [A_{ij}]$.

\noindent \\ \textit{Definition.} The \textbf{diagonal entries}of $A$ are $A_{ii}$.

\noindent \\ \textit{Definition.} The \textbf{square matrix} is a matrix which has same number of rows and columns (so the size is $n \times n$). \textbf{Diagonal matrix} is a square matrix which has its nondiagonal entries as 0. A diagonal matrix with all of its diagonal entries are the same are \textbf{scalar matrix}. If the value of diagonal entries are all 1, it is \textbf{identity matrix}.

\noindent A $n \times n$ identity matrix is denoted as $I_n$, and
\begin{align*}
I_n = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

\noindent A \textbf{zero matrix} $O$ is a matrix which all of its entires are zero.

\noindent \\ \textit{Definition.} Two matrices are \textbf{equal} if and only if

(i) The size of two matrices are the same.

(ii) The corresponding entries of the matrices are the same.
